# Dependecies

## Running + testing Weaver algorithm
As long as you have python installed you can run and tests your weaver algorithms, my implementation uses the built-in json and unittest libraries.

## Solving Weaver on the web

### selenium
Selenium is used to along with a webdriver to interact with the weaver webpage and scrape the information from the website

### webDriver
If you don't already have a webdriver I would download a chrome webdriver from [driverDownload](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads). 

### pyautogui 
This currently uses pyuatogui to interact with your keyboard to type the solution into the web browser although im looking to remove this dependecies and do this through selenium.
